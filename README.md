# parity-algo-path-lab

`parity-algo-path-lab` treats algorithms as a local verification problem. The OCaml implementation is intentionally narrow, but the fixtures and notes make the behavior explicit.

## Parity Algo Path Lab Checkpoints

Treat the compact fixture as the contract and the extended examples as a scratchpad. The code should stay boring enough that a change in behavior is obvious from the test output.

## What This Is For

The repository exists to keep a technical idea small enough to reason about. The implementation avoids external dependencies where possible, then uses fixtures to make changes easy to review.

## Architecture Notes

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The OCaml implementation keeps the data record and functions small enough to load directly in the test file.

## Case Study

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Useful Pieces

- Uses fixture data to keep complexity tradeoffs changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for golden cases, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents boundary checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Tooling

Install OCaml and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.

## Quality Gate

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Project Layout

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Scope

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Expansion Ideas

- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add one more algorithms fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Local Workflow

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.
